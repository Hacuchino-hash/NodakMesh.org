## The Key Spec: 1 Watt Output

The standout feature is the **1W (30 dBm) transmit power** made possible by the SKY66122 power amplifier. For context, most standard Meshtastic nodes operate around 100-250mW. This significant power increase translates directly to extended range potential, which matters in regions like ours where nodes can be miles apart.

## Technical Specifications

| Spec | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **MCU** | nRF52840 |
| **LoRa Transceiver** | SX1262 |
| **Power Amplifier** | SKY66122 |
| **TX Power** | Up to 30 dBm (1W) |
| **Frequency** | 900 MHz band |
| **Interface** | USB-C |
| **Battery Support** | Yes (via RAK19007 base board) |

## Pricing

The WisMesh 1W Booster Starter Kit is available at **$39 USD** from the [RAKwireless store](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wismesh-1w-booster-starter-kit).

## Why This Matters

For mesh network builders, particularly those working across rural or sparsely populated areas, transmit power is often the limiting factor for reliable node-to-node communication. Having a reasonably-priced, high-power option directly from a reputable manufacturer like RAKwireless gives the community another solid tool in the toolbox.

The WisBlock modular design also means this kit can be expanded with additional sensors, GPS modules, and enclosures from the broader RAK ecosystem.

It's exciting to see manufacturers continuing to invest in the Meshtastic ecosystem with purpose-built hardware at accessible price points. For those of us building mesh networks in challenging environments, more options like this are always welcome.
