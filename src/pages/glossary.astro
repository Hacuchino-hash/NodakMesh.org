  {
    term: "LoRa",
    definition: "Long Range. A wireless modulation technique that enables long-distance, low-power radio communication. LoRa operates in unlicensed ISM bands (915 MHz in North America, 868 MHz in Europe) and can achieve ranges of several kilometers with minimal power consumption.",
    related: ["LoRaWAN", "ISM Band", "Chirp Spread Spectrum"]
  },
  {
    term: "LoRaWAN",
    definition: "Long Range Wide Area Network. A network protocol built on top of LoRa that defines how devices communicate with gateways and servers. LoRaWAN is designed for IoT applications and requires internet-connected gateways. Note: Meshtastic and MeshCore do NOT use LoRaWAN — they use LoRa directly in a peer-to-peer mesh configuration.",
    related: ["LoRa", "Mesh Network"]
  },
  {
    term: "Mesh Network",
    definition: "A network topology where each node can relay data for other nodes, creating multiple paths for messages to travel. If one node fails, messages can route around it. This makes mesh networks resilient and self-healing.",
    related: ["Hop", "Node", "Flood Routing"]
  },
  {
    term: "Node",
    definition: "A single device in a mesh network. In Meshtastic and MeshCore, a node is typically a small LoRa radio module that can send, receive, and relay messages.",

  },
  {
    term: "Hop",
    definition: "A single transmission between two nodes. When a message travels through multiple nodes to reach its destination, each relay is called a hop. More hops mean longer potential range but also more latency.",
    related: ["Hop Limit", "Mesh Network"]
  },
  {
    term: "Hop Limit",
    definition: "The maximum number of times a message can be relayed before it stops propagating. This prevents messages from bouncing around the network forever. Meshtastic defaults to 3 hops (max 7), while MeshCore supports up to 64 hops.",
    related: ["Hop", "TTL"]
  },
  {
    term: "TTL",

    related: ["Hop Limit", "Hop"]
  },
  {
    term: "SWR",

    related: ["Antenna", "dBm"]
  },
  {
    term: "dBm",

  },
  {
    term: "RSSI",

    related: ["SNR", "dBm"]
  },
  {
    term: "SNR",
    definition: "Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The difference between the signal level and the background noise, measured in dB. Positive SNR means the signal is stronger than noise. LoRa can decode signals with negative SNR (below the noise floor), which is part of what makes it so long-range.",

  },
  {
    term: "Spreading Factor",

  },
  {
    term: "Duty Cycle",
    definition: "The percentage of time a device is allowed to transmit. In some regions (especially Europe), regulations limit LoRa duty cycle to 1% or less. This means for every second of transmission, you must wait 99 seconds before transmitting again.",
